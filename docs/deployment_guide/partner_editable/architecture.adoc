image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the QuickStart sets up the following:

* Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets to store the following:
** Weather and topology data from external databases.
** Raw meter data.
** Partitioned data.
** Processed data from the AWS Step Functions model training workflow.
* AWS Lambda functions to do the following:
** Load and transform topology data from an external database.
** Process late-arriving meter data.
** Obtain API query results of partitioned business data and Amazon SageMaker inferences.
* An AWS Glue crawler to transform meter data from Meter data management (MDM) system and head end system (HES) systems into partitioned data.
* Amazon EventBridge to process and store late-arriving meter data in the correct partition.
* AWS Glue Data Catalog for a central catalog of weather, topology, and meter data.
* Amazon Athena to provide query results of partitioned data.
* Two Step Function workflows.
** Model training to build an ML model using partitioned business data.
** Batch processing of partitioned business data from AWS Glue Data Catalog and ML model data for use in forecasting.
* SageMaker to generate energy usage inferences using the ML model.
* Amazon API Gateway to manage API queries.
