=== Set up Amazon Managed Grafana
This solution includes a set of Amazon Managed Grafana dashboards. These dashboards use Amazon Athena to query data stored in a data lake and depend on several of the optional datasets for full functionality.

Amazon Managed Grafana supports SAML and AWS SSO for authentication. If your organization does not have SAML or AWS SSO set up, you should work with your AWS Admins to activate AWS SSO. Also as of this time there is no Cloudformation support for Amazon Managed Grafana, so these steps will walk you through:

* Creating a Grafana workspace
* Setting up AWS SSO for workspace access
* Setting up permissions for Grafana to access Athena
* Installing the dashboards and connecting to Athena

=== Creating a Grafana workspace
. In the https://console.aws.amazon.com/grafana[Amazon Managed Grafana] console, choose *Create workspace*.

. Enter a *Workspace Name*. If desired, enter an optional *Workspace Description*.
. Choose *Next*.
. On the *Configure Settings* page, for *Authentication access*, select *Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)*.
. For *Permission type*, choose *Service managed*.
. Choose *Next*.
. On the *Service managed permission settings* page, for *IAM permission access settings*, choose *Current account*.
. For *Data sources and notification channels*, select *Amazon Athena*.
. Choose *Next*.
. Choose *Create workspace*.

=== Set up SSO or SAML
After the workspace finishes creating, you'll need to go in and select the SSO users and groups you wish to give access to Grafana. Once that is done, you should be able to log into your Grafana instance through the *Grafana workspace URL* provided in the console.

=== Set up Athena Data Source in Grafana
Follow the AWS or Grafana docs for setting up Athena as a Data Source in Grafana:

. https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/add-a-data-source/[Grafana Docs]


=== Import the dashboards into Grafana

. Login into the Grafana console using either SAML or SSO.
. Select the *+* icon and go to import

. Either copy in json from the /grafana/<dashboard-name>.json files in the repo or directly upload the json files

After importing the tables, there may be some updates needed to match the configured data sources and glue database names chosen. If many errors pop up, go in and check the panels' data sources as well as the variables in the dashboard settings menus.
